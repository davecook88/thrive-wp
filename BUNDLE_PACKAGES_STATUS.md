# Bundle Packages Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22 (Phase 4 Complete)
**Overall Progress**: ~50% Complete (Phases 1-4 Done, Core Backend Complete)

## Summary

Implementation of bundle packages feature enabling students to purchase packages containing multiple service types (PRIVATE, GROUP, COURSE) with independent credit tracking per type.

## Architectural Decision: Single Source of Truth

**Key Decision**: PackageUse records are the authoritative source. Remaining credits are **computed** from:
```
remaining_credits = total_sessions - SUM(PackageUse.credits_used)
```

This eliminates denormalization and allows for materialized views later if performance becomes an issue.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Schema (100%)

**Migration File**: `apps/nestjs/src/migrations/1762000000010-BundlePackagesMigration.ts`

**Tables Created**:
- `package_allowance` - Defines what's included in each bundle
  - `stripe_product_map_id` (FK)
  - `service_type` (PRIVATE, GROUP, COURSE)
  - `teacher_tier` (0 = any)
  - `credits` (quantity)
  - `credit_unit_minutes` (15/30/45/60)

**Columns Modified**:
- Removed `service_type`, `teacher_tier` from `stripe_product_map`
- Removed `remaining_sessions` from `student_package`
- Added `service_type`, `credits_used` to `package_use`

**Migration Features**:
- ✓ Full up() and down() migration
- ✓ Data migration from old schema
- ✓ Backward compatible
- ✓ Rollback verified

### ✅ Phase 2: TypeORM Entities (100%)

**New Entities**:

1. **PackageAllowance** (`apps/nestjs/src/packages/entities/package-allowance.entity.ts`)
   - Represents one service type's allocation in a bundle
   - Relations: ManyToOne StripeProductMap

2. **Updated StudentPackage** (`apps/nestjs/src/packages/entities/student-package.entity.ts`)
   - Removed: `remainingSessions` column
   - Added: `uses` OneToMany relation to PackageUse (lazy loaded)
   - Balances computed from uses on-demand

3. **Updated StripeProductMap** (`apps/nestjs/src/payments/entities/stripe-product-map.entity.ts`)
   - Removed: `serviceType`, `teacherTier` columns
   - Added: `allowances` OneToMany relation (eager loaded)

4. **Updated PackageUse** (`apps/nestjs/src/packages/entities/package-use.entity.ts`)
   - Added: `serviceType` (tracks which balance was used)
   - Added: `creditsUsed` (can be > 1)

### ✅ Phase 3: DTOs & Types (100%)

**Updated File**: `packages/shared/src/types/packages.ts`

**New Types**:
- `PackageAllowanceSchema` - Defines one allowance
- Updated `CreatePackageSchema` - Now accepts `allowances` array
- Updated `PackageResponseSchema` - Returns `allowances` array
- Updated `CompatiblePackageSchema` - Includes `allowances`

**Key Changes**:
- ✓ Removed single `serviceType` → Now `allowances[]`
- ✓ Removed single `credits` → Now distributed in allowances
- ✓ Added `bundleDescription` (auto-generated or custom)
- ✓ Backward-compatible `StudentPackage` type (computed `remainingSessions`)

### ✅ Phase 4: Service Layer - Utilities (100%)

**New Utility Files**:

1. **bundle-helpers.ts** (`apps/nestjs/src/packages/utils/bundle-helpers.ts`)
   - `computeRemainingCredits()` - Aggregate PackageUse
   - `computeRemainingCreditsByServiceType()` - Filter by type, then aggregate
   - `generateBundleDescription()` - Auto-generate "5 Private (30min) + 3 Group"
   - `findAllowanceForServiceType()` - Find matching allowance
   - `bundleContainsServiceType()` - Check if bundle has type
   - `validateAllowances()` - Validate bundle configuration

2. **package-query-builder.ts** (`apps/nestjs/src/packages/utils/package-query-builder.ts`)
   - `buildPackageMappingQuery()` - Query with allowances
   - `buildActivePackageMappingQuery()` - With active filter
   - `buildPackagesForSessionTypeQuery()` - Filter by session type
   - `buildActiveStudentPackagesQuery()` - With uses loaded
   - `loadPackageUses()` - Async load for computation

## In Progress Work

### ✅ Phase 4: Service Layer - PackagesService Methods (100%)

**Status**: COMPLETE - All methods refactored and working

**Completed**:
- ✅ All imports and dependencies configured
- ✅ Helper methods: `buildPackageResponse()`, `buildPackageResponses()`
- ✅ Read methods: `getPackages()`, `getActivePackages()`, `getValidPackagesForSession()`, `getPackage()`
- ✅ Write methods: `createPackage()` (creates bundles with allowances)
- ✅ Balance computation: `getActivePackagesForStudent()` (computes remaining from PackageUse)
- ✅ Complex method: `getCompatiblePackagesForSession()` (returns packages with allowances)
- ✅ Core utility: `usePackageForSession()` (accepts options, creates PackageUse)

**Details**:
- All methods properly handle `allowances` array
- Remaining credits computed from `PackageUse` records (no denormalized columns)
- Pessimistic locking implemented for balance updates
- PackageQueryBuilder used throughout for clean data loading

### ✅ Phase 4.5: Other Services (100%)

- ✅ **PaymentsService.handlePackagePurchase()**: Creates PackageUse records correctly
- ✅ **BookingsService.createBooking()**: Uses PackageQueryBuilder for balance validation
- ✅ Type system fixed: ServiceType exported and re-usable across modules

## Upcoming Work

### ⏳ Phase 5: API Controllers
- Update `packages.controller.ts` responses with new DTOs
- Update `admin-packages.controller.ts` for bundle creation

## How to Continue from Here

### Quick Start for Phase 5 (Next)

The service layer is complete. To continue with API layer:

1. **Location**: `apps/nestjs/src/packages/packages.controller.ts`
2. **Task**: Update endpoint responses to use new DTOs
3. **Reference**: Check `packages/shared/src/types/packages.ts` for DTO schemas

### Build & Test

Verify your work:
```bash
npm run type-check            # Check types
npm run build                 # Full monorepo build
```

### Key Implementation Notes

- ✅ Core service layer is production-ready
- ✅ All data transformations for allowances are in place
- ✅ Balance computation is robust and efficient
- Next: Expose functionality through API and UI layers

## Design Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: PackageUse records only
2. **Computed Balances**: No denormalization, use SQL aggregation if needed later
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Old packages work as bundles with 1 allowance
4. **Flexible Tiers**: Support different tier requirements per service type
5. **Transaction Safety**: Pessimistic locking on package use

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Large refactoring | Step-by-step guide minimizes errors |
| Performance queries | Can add materialized views later |
| Data migration | Full migration with rollback tested |
| Backward compat | Type system enforces new structure |
| Race conditions | Pessimistic locking in usePackageForSession |

## Questions?

Refer to the implementation guides for detailed explanations of each change.

The codebase is designed for maintainability:
- Utilities are separated in `/utils/`
- Methods have clear docstring explanations
- Type system is strict with Zod validation
