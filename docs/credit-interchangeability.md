## Problem Statement

When a student clicks on a group class, the UI currently shows "book with package" without differentiating between private and group class credits. This creates several issues:

1. **Assumption of credit compatibility**: The system assumes any package credit can be used for any session type
2. **Pricing disparity**: Private class credits are more expensive than group class credits, but the UI doesn't reflect this
3. **No explicit consent**: Students aren't aware they're using a higher-value credit for a lower-value service
4. **Refund ambiguity**: When canceling a booking made with a private credit for a group class, which type of credit should be refunded?
5. **Course classes**: Group classes attached to courses should only be bookable by students enrolled in that course

## Solution: Tier-Based Credit System

### Core Concept

Credits are assigned **internal tiers** based on their service type and optional teacher requirements:

- **PRIVATE credits**: Base tier 100 + teacher tier
- **GROUP credits**: Base tier 50 + teacher tier
- **COURSE sessions**: Use enrollment validation, not credits

**Validation rule**: A credit can be used for any session with equal or lower tier.

### User-Facing Design

Students see **labels, not tiers**:
- "Private Credit" / "Group Credit"
- "Premium Private Credit" (if teacher tier > 0)
- Duration displayed: "60-minute credit", "30-minute credit"

**UI flow**:
1. **Exact match available**: Auto-select matching credit type
2. **Only higher-tier available**: Show with confirmation modal
3. **Confirmation**: "Use a private credit for this group class?"

### Key Rules

1. ✅ **Private credits CAN be used for group classes** (with confirmation)
2. ❌ **Group credits CANNOT be used for private classes** (tier validation prevents)
3. 🔄 **Refunds go to original package** (`booking.studentPackageId` tracking)
4. ➗ **Credits are fractional** - 60-minute credit can be used for two 30-minute sessions

### Technical Implementation

#### Tier Calculation

```typescript
// Session tier
sessionTier = BASE_SERVICE_TIER[session.type] + session.teacher.tier

// Package tier
packageTier = BASE_SERVICE_TIER[pkg.metadata.service_type] + pkg.metadata.teacher_tier

// Validation
canUse = packageTier >= sessionTier
```

#### Credit Consumption

```typescript
creditsCost = Math.ceil(sessionDuration / creditUnitMinutes)
```

Examples:
- 60-min credit for 60-min session: 1 credit
- 60-min credit for 30-min session: 1 credit (rounds up)
- 30-min credit for 60-min session: 2 credits

#### Refund Logic

```typescript
// ALWAYS refund to booking.studentPackageId
pkg.remainingSessions += booking.creditsCost

// Examples:
// - Private credit used for group → refund private credit
// - Group credit used for group → refund group credit
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation & Backend Logic (No UI Changes)
- Deploy tier calculation functions
- Add new endpoint but don't use in UI yet
- Validate existing bookings still work
- **No user impact**

### Phase 2: Update Booking Flow
- Update UI to use new endpoint
- Add confirmation modal for tier mismatch
- Feature flag for gradual rollout
- **Visible changes, but optional**

### Phase 3: Enforce Validation
- Enable tier validation on all bookings
- Block invalid cross-tier attempts
- **May affect existing workflows**

### Phase 4: Update Cancellation Flow
- Ensure refunds go to correct package
- Monitor refund accuracy
- **Backend only, transparent to users**

## Edge Cases Addressed

1. **Multiple compatible packages**: Algorithm selects closest to expiration, then FIFO
2. **Duration mismatch**: UI shows warning, rounds up credit consumption
3. **Race conditions**: Pessimistic locking prevents double-booking last credit
4. **Package expires during booking**: Validation at booking creation time rejects
5. **Package deleted after booking**: Soft-delete approach allows refund tracking
6. **Course sessions**: Separate validation path (enrollment, not credits)
7. **Cross-tier without confirmation**: Server requires `confirmed: true` flag

## Success Criteria

✅ Students can use PRIVATE credits for GROUP classes with clear confirmation
✅ GROUP credits cannot be used for PRIVATE classes (validated and blocked)
✅ Cancellations refund to original package regardless of session type
✅ Course sessions use enrollment system, not package credits
✅ UI clearly labels credit types without exposing numeric tiers
✅ No regression in existing private booking flow
✅ Comprehensive documentation for future developers
✅ Transaction safety for all credit operations

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Students confused by cross-tier booking | Medium | Clear UI confirmation with explanation |
| Refund logic breaks for edge cases | High | Comprehensive testing + transaction safety |
| Teacher tier undefined causing errors | Medium | Default to 0, add NOT NULL constraint |
| Performance impact from tier calculations | Low | Simple arithmetic, no database calls |
| Race condition on last credit | Medium | Already handled by pessimistic locking |

## Future Enhancements

1. **GROUP-only packages**: Lower-priced packages restricted to group classes only
2. **Premium teacher tiers**: Display "Premium" badge for high-tier teachers
3. **Dynamic pricing**: Variable pricing based on tier level
4. **Credit pooling**: Share credits between family members
5. **Multi-currency support**: Different packages per currency with tier parity
6. **Teacher tier management**: Admin UI to set and adjust teacher tiers

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. **Package selection**: Should we use expiry-first or let students choose every time?
   - **Recommendation**: Expiry-first with manual override option

2. **Duration warnings**: How prominently should we warn about mismatched durations?
   - **Recommendation**: Inline info message, not blocking modal

3. **GROUP packages**: Do we need to create them, or wait for demand?
   - **Recommendation**: Wait - PRIVATE credits already work for GROUP classes

4. **Teacher tiers**: Should we show "Premium" proactively or only in edge cases?
   - **Recommendation**: Show badge on teacher profiles and class listings

5. **Analytics**: What metrics should we track for credit usage patterns?
   - **Recommendation**: Cross-tier booking rate, credit waste (unused portions), expiration rates

**Total**: ~2-3 weeks for full implementation and testing

## Critical Path

1. Tier calculation utilities → Package compatibility endpoint
2. Booking validation → Credit selection UI
3. Refund logic → Cancellation updates
4. Integration testing → E2E validation
5. Feature flag rollout → Full deployment
